# FeedMedia

## Introduction

[Feed.fm](https://feed.fm/) is a service that allows you to add popular
music to your mobile app. The SDK hosted in this repository provides
you with simple UI components that you can adapt or use directly in your
app.

## Installation

FeedMedia is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "FeedMedia"
```

If you want to try out a sample app before installing, run

```bash
pod try FeedMedia
```

## Installation without CocoaPods

If you aren't using CocoaPods but want to integrate this library in your
application, we suggest you clone this repository into a subdirectory
of your project, include all files in `Core/*`, `UI/*`, and (if
desired) all the assets in `Assets/*`.

## Tell me more!

Creating a custom music station requires you to create an account on
[Feed.fm](https://feed.fm), but you can try out our sample app here
with the included demo credentials. You can also check out a prettier
[sample radio player app](https://github.com/feedfm/iOS-RadioPlayer),
located on GitHub, that uses this library.
